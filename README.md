Some algorithms from FreeCodeCamp
=================================

My solutions for "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" from the JavasriptPart, and small analisis for complexity of each one.
Also its going to be a first day of #100daysOfCod, till I get more fun project to code.

Why? Maybe because Im bored and why not. Always loved this kind of stuff in my degree... 
If you know better solution, you know what to do. You can find all the challenges here:
