Look inside object collection

My solution I belive have O(N*M) complexity, like any common nested loop. No idea if there a way to add beter eficiency. Maybe if there some way to check for "object" equality, without doing a loop. 

Look inside of an object collection and return an array off ojects that match the "key, value" pair provided in the second arguments.
