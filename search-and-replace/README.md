Seek and Destroy Algorithm from Free Code Camp
==============================================

Very easy one, feels like I did it wrong. Why I should seek and destroy, when exists "replace" function in JavaScript. You just check for first capitalize letter and nothing more, in the before argument, for preserve it.

Also the eficiency of this one is linear, actually depends of the complexity of the replace function. But it just O(1)...

Feels strange, but it pass all test.
