Solution for Spinal Case Algorithm from FreeCodeCamp
====================================================

Common string "beautify" for create preaty urls. Feels bad about this one, but it pass the test. I belive that exists better solutions and whole libraries for this matter, because its important.

For example this one dont remove special chars like "!&$" and so on, also its dont work for spanish letters like Ã‘...

But its works...

I guess the eficiency of this one is something like O(N + k) in the worst scenario it depends of efficiency of functions like replace() and toLowerCase();
